# ✈️ TourReminder! 🗺️

Hey there! 👋

This is TourReminder, my first Flutter and your friendly app to keep track of all your upcoming tours and adventures! 🎉

## What's it all about? 🤔

TourReminder helps you remember when and where your tours are.  You can add all the important details, like:

*   📅 **When:** The start and end dates of your tour.
*   📍 **Where:** The location you're visiting.
*   📝 **What:** A short description of the tour.
*   ✍️ **Remarks:** Any extra notes or things to remember.

The app then shows you on the home screen how many days are left until your tour starts!  No more missed trips! 🥳

## What's in the box? 📦

This project is built with Flutter, which means it works on both Android and iOS!  The design is inspired by a cool Figma design 
(check it out!: [here](https://www.figma.com/design/jFZ2j91C5y1FRKIxselzt4/Tourminder-%F0%9F%8F%9D%EF%B8%8F-%7C-Travel-Planner-App-(Community)?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=RTd1cgRekUPfwx2T-0))

## Where are we now? 🚧

Right now, TourReminder is still under construction. 🚧  You can add, edit, and delete tour reminders, but they disappear when you close the app.  Think of it like a sticky note for now! 📝

## What's next? 🚀

I'm working hard to add these awesome features:

*   💾 **Saving Data:**  So your reminders stay put, even when you close the app!
*   ✨ **More Features:**  Maybe some cool map integrations or packing lists?  The sky's the limit!

## Thanks for checking it out! 🙏

Happy travels! ✈️
